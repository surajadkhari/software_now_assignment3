## **Introduction**

This group project focuses on creating two unique Python applications that demonstrate object-oriented programming (**OOP**) concepts:
1. **Employee Attendance System**: A Tkinter-based desktop application for tracking employee work shifts.
2. **2D Tank Game**: A Pygame-based side-scrolling game that involves controlling a tank through different levels, fighting enemies, and collecting power-ups.

These projects not only implement OOP principles but also provide practical real-world applications in both the workplace (attendance system) and entertainment (game development).

---

## **Project Highlights**

### **1. Employee Attendance System (Tkinter)**

- **Admin Features**: Admins can add or remove employees.
- **Shift Management**: Employees can start and end shifts, with shift duration tracked and stored.
- **CSV Integration**: Employee data and attendance records are stored in CSV files for easy tracking and reporting.
- **Validation**: Employee ID validation ensures data accuracy and security.

### **2. 2D Side-Scrolling Tank Game (Pygame)**

- **Player Control**: Navigate a tank, shoot projectiles, and engage with enemies.
- **Multiple Levels**: Three challenging levels with increasing difficulty, including a final boss battle.
- **Health and Scoring System**: Tracks player health, lives, and score.
- **Collectibles**: Pick up health boosts and extra lives to keep your tank in the fight.
- **Dynamic Camera**: Smoothly follows the player through the battlefield.
- **Game Over & Restart**: When lives are lost, the game offers the option to restart.

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `tkinter`, `pygame`, `csv`, `datetime`

### **Steps to Install and Run**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/assignment.git
   cd assignment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Tkinter Employee Attendance System**:
   ```bash
   python tkinter_attendance_system.py
   ```

4. **Run the Pygame Tank Game**:
   ```bash
   python tank_game.py
   ```

---

## **OOP Concepts Used**

- **Encapsulation**: Each feature (employee management, shift tracking, player actions) is enclosed in separate classes, keeping the code clean and modular.
- **Polymorphism**: Different game objects (tanks, enemies, projectiles) interact in unique ways, showcasing different behaviors.
- **Method Overriding**: Both applications override certain class methods to extend functionality, such as handling attendance shifts or game mechanics.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: The Tkinter app demonstrates multiple inheritance, combining GUI functionality with OOP.

---

## **Lessons Learned & Future Ideas**

**What We Learned**:
- **Practical Application of OOP**: We applied object-oriented design to build scalable and modular applications.
- **Exploring Python Libraries**: Using Tkinter for a real-world business tool and Pygame for a fun interactive game made learning Python more exciting.
- **Team Collaboration**: Working in a group helped us understand code collaboration, version control, and efficient project management.

**Future Ideas**:
- **For the Attendance System**: Add automated report generation and employee performance insights based on attendance data.
- **For the Tank Game**: Introduce more enemy types, new power-ups, and multiplayer functionality for added excitement.

## **Conclusion**

This group project was an excellent opportunity to explore object-oriented programming through two different applications. From managing employee attendance to building a fun tank game, we saw how OOP can be applied to solve both real-world problems and create entertainment.

We hope you find these projects useful and fun to interact with!
